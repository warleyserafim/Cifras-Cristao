## Deploying the API to Render using Docker

This guide assumes you have a Render account and your project is connected to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

1.  **Commit and Push Changes:**
    First, commit the newly created `Dockerfile` and any other changes to your Git repository:
    ```bash
    git add api/Dockerfile
    git commit -m "Add Dockerfile for API deployment on Render"
    git push
    ```

2.  **Create a New Web Service on Render:**
    *   Go to your Render dashboard.
    *   Click on "New Web Service".
    *   Select your Git repository.

3.  **Configure the Web Service:**
    *   **Root Directory:** Set this to `api/` (or the directory where your `Dockerfile` is located relative to your repository root).
    *   **Runtime:** Select "Docker".
    *   **Build Command:** Leave empty (Docker will handle the build process based on the `Dockerfile`).
    *   **Start Command:** Leave empty (the `CMD` instruction in your `Dockerfile` will handle this).
    *   **Name:** Give your service a name (e.g., `cifras-club-api`).
    *   **Region:** Choose a region close to your users.
    *   **Branch:** Select the branch you want to deploy from (e.g., `main` or `master`).
    *   **Instance Type:** Choose an instance type based on your expected traffic and resource needs.
    *   **Environment Variables (Optional but Recommended):** If your API needs any environment variables (e.g., database connection strings, API keys), add them here. For example, if you have a `.env` file locally, you'll need to add those variables to Render.

4.  **Deploy:**
    *   Click "Create Web Service".

Render will now pull your repository, detect the `Dockerfile` in the specified root directory, build the Docker image, and deploy your API service.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Database:** Ensure your database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) is also accessible from Render. If it's a local database, you'll need to migrate it or set up a cloud-hosted database.
*   **Environment Variables:** Double-check that all necessary environment variables are configured in Render.
*   **Port:** The `Dockerfile` exposes port 3000. Make sure your Node.js application is configured to listen on `process.env.PORT` (which Render sets) or specifically on port 3000 if you hardcode it.
*   **`yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` updates:** Keep an eye on updates for `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg`. You might need to update the `Dockerfile` periodically to get the latest versions.
*   **`librosa` dependencies:** The `chord_recognizer.py` script uses `librosa`. Ensure that `librosa` and its Python dependencies are installed within the Docker image. You might need to add `RUN pip3 install librosa` to your Dockerfile if it's not already handled by `yt-dlp`'s dependencies or if `librosa` has specific system-level dependencies.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to help with any other part of the deployment process!
