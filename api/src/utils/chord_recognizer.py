        # This is just to get some output for the API.
        # Real chord recognition is much more involved.
        
        # For a more realistic approach, one would typically use a pre-trained model
        # or implement a more complex algorithm based on chroma features and harmonic analysis.
        
        # Let's create some dummy chords for now to ensure the pipeline works.
        # In a real scenario, this would be replaced by actual chord recognition.
